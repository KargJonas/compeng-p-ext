Base knowledge:
  - The B extension has been ratified in April of 2024
  - B stands for "bit manipulation"
  - B is comprised of several component extensions (zba, zbb, zbc, zbs)
  - 8/16-bit supported
  - P is likely part of the unprivileged instructions
  - we should prob limit to one quantization and one instructions
  - Spike supports v0.9.2 (recent enough)
  - the bulk of the work will be in extending llvm's backend
  - the most interesting files are in llvm/lib/Target/RISCV
    - RISCVInstrInfo.td		(define new instructions)
    - RISCVISelLowering.td
    - RISCVMCTargetDesc.td
    - RISCVISelLowering.td	(lowering)
    - RISCVIntrinsics.td	(intrinsics)

A good starting point before we even mess with LLVM might be to write
and run some RISC-V asm using the P-extension to get a feel for it.
